/**
 *  The same as SimpleAdaptiveTestingStrategy, but using generators. The workflow
 *  is not fully async though, since there is certain  inversion of control here:
 *  because angular has its own event loop (digest cycle), and because the template
 *  for single test we use here, uses the method call (hasNext()) to determine 
 *  whether or not to render the Next button, the generator of tests is here driven
 *  by angular. Once the user gives some answer to a current question, the hasNext()
 *  method is called and uses a separate branch, which fetches the next test.
 * 
 *  What we'd perhaps want to do would be to reverse the order / control, so that 
 *  once the user gives an answer, we first fetch the next question, and then let
 *  the angular know, so that the generator / coroutine is the one to take control,
 *  and angular is a driven one.
